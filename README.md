# nock-swagger
This projects autogenerates strongly typed methods to easily set up [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) mocks for API calls based on Swagger API definitions.
So, given that you have a [petstore-like API definition](https://petstore.swagger.io/), you could autogenerate a list of [nock helper methods](https://github.com/Shaddix/nock-swagger/blob/master/examples/pet-client/__tests__/nock-helpers.ts), to easily mock methods from the API.


****This library requires, [dotnet runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/2.1) (2.1) installed on your machine! If you have .NET Core 3+ or 5+ you'll need to add a switch (e.g. /runtime:Net50) to all commands.****

## How to add
Install the package into your project using yarn/npm (as a dev-dependency). You'll also need to add react-query (which you probably already have if you are interested in this library).
```
yarn add -D nock-swagger
```
Then create/update your autogenerated hooks by calling (adjusting the URL and output path)
```
yarn nock-swagger /input:https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json /output:__tests__/nock-helpers.ts
```
You would probably want to add this script to your package.json to call it every time your API changes.

## Configuration
##### setBaseUrl(baseUrl: string)
Sets base URL for all methods

## How does it work
Under the cover it's just 2 template files for [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag) and a small script to easily use them.
